      "Don't think too much to buy this phoneIt is the best phone in this price segment...Then also it is good enough to compare with any other high range phonesNo other Mobile companies will offer u this much hardware and specifications in this price..... Snapdragon 625 2ghz with sony 12mp with 5300 mah reversible charging support, gorilla glass protection and 6.44inch good colour productive screen and much more..... The best thing is u can use it easily 1.5 days with very heavy usage.....And those who r complaining about the camera.... Just set the cameras in mannual mode and take pictures..... I have attached some samples of rear camera and front camera pics.... Just see that pics.... And the pics are not taken in sunlight.....all the pics are taken in cloudy weatherWhile recording Videos turn off the auto focus option and  use tap to focus to make qud quality videosand yes its support quick charge 3.0 which can charge ur mob from 0 to 100 in just 2hrAnd there is no heating issue for normal useBut while playing very heavy games a little bit heats on back which is common for all handset.Ya its bit bigger than other phone so it feels odd for first 2days then u feel comfortable with this..... I m sharing this because i used this phone for 15 days and then m writing this review.Bit slippery too so use a cover for protect ur phone...... don't buy any other screen protector.....go to mi.com and from there u can buy the original mi max2 screen protector which fits the screen perfectly and it has 3 pieces of screen guard which comes with only 200rs.....Stereo speakers are awesome and in ear earphones are sounds perfectly....Its design and build quality is awsm and impressiveLooks premium.If low light camera is not necessary to u then do not think too much and go for it....I m a heavy mobile user so i m sharing my experience...do not go with the fraud comments.....Jst buy it and then u will think that m right....Thank u friends for reading my full review\n",

      "The real winner.Many might be apprehensive of using a 6.44 inch smartphone but wait a minute... Read my review and then decide.I will make it easy for you to decide.I purchased it on 28th of July 2017 and got it on 29th July Morning. It was a real surprise for me.  Good Job Amazon.Specifications:Screen- 6.44 inches, Full HD (1080p), with Gorilla Glass 3 protection.RAM- 4 GBInternal memory- 64 GB (54 GB was free at the time of first boot)Processor- Snapdragon 625, 2.0 GhzSensors- Fingerprint, IR Blaster, Gyro etc.Speakers- Dual- One at top and one at bottom. (Sound is crisp and clear)Camera- 12 Mp rear and 5 Mp Frontcamera lens- Sony IMX 386 (same as MI6)Android-7.1.1 Nougat, running on MIUI 8.5If I missed something, you please rectify.Now review:The first and best part is that with 6.44 inches it never feels like one.  So,  slim and well designed it is that I am using it quite comfortably since last 2 days.Of course it is big but believe me it is really very well designed. Also,  despite 5,300 MAH battery it is so light that you will be astonished. My Asus Zenfone selfie having 3,000 MAH battery is heavier.  Really,  it's my actual experience.Also, despite its 6.44 inch screen it is not that it becomes completely uncomfortable to hold it in one hand.The curvy edges make it very handy. Also, one hand use mode is given to use it in one hand sometimes.Now,  performance:This was the part for which I decided to go for it. The tried and tested Snapdragon 625 is giving it's worth. Combined by 5300 mah battery it is giving me superb back up.I charged it on 29th July at 12 noon.Till 30th night 11 pm it was having still 24% charge left.  This is after 4 to 5 hrs of gaming,  continuously using Whatsapp,  facebook and watching videos on facebook. And I am using it too much just to see how much power it can give me.So, you have a powerful battery that will last you 2 days with heavy usage and 3 days with moderate usage. If you are a completely insane gamer, still it will last you more than one day.So, 10/10 to battery.Besides you get Qualcomm quick charge facility with this. Charger is quite fast and charges this massive battery of 5300 MAH in just about 2 to 2.5 hours.Camera:Camera is the part on which Xiaomi has worked this time.  In daytime it cliks really good pictures. I clicked some photos during day time and it came out very good that was not expected from a Xiaomi device. (I have uploaded a few photographs clicked yesterday i.e. 03.08.2017 by this camera now. Please clik on photos to see the quality of images)The shutter is quite fast and sensors are good. So,  images come out well detailed.Far better than Redmi Note 4. My friend has it and he acknowledged this part.Selfie camera is quite OK...here it could have been made better. Not the best still gives good pictures.But altogether front camera is ok.Sensors:It is having all the sensors including IR Blaster. Gyro is there. You have to download a VR App,  purchase a VR glass and enjoy VR Videos.Finger print works very smooth.Screen:Screen is another part where it gives you worth it's price. Very bright and clear. Sunlight legibility is very good. And with 6.44 inches watching videos, movies, gaming is like out of the world. You will not get anything better.Calling:Voice clarity was good all the times. And speaker gives good sound. Also, signals were good every time.As it is light and well designed I didn't feel uncomfortable in holding it to my ears for 29 to 30 minutes of calling.Speakers:Loud and clear. With dual Stereo Speakers you will love to listen songs, watch videos, movies etc.Just add any VR app and you will love to watch big screen videos.Price:At 16,999/- it's a very good deal as it gives you all the things in one package.Verdict:It has got everything at such price. It's only drawback (if you really believe it is a drawback) is it's screen size. With 6.44 inches it is not that easy to handle in one hand. But believe me Xiaomi has tried and succeeded in making it as easy as possible to use it by too good design. I am using it and will use it as my primary device. With so many good features the screen size will not matter much for me.It's up to you to decide.Performance and camera is superior to Redmi Note 4. Of course it is also having Snapdragon 625 chip but I feel in this device Xiaomi has worked more on software optimisation and given even better performance. Also, Camera sensors are the best in a Xiaomi device till date.So, if you can adjust with big screen, this smartphone or phablet will give you best performance and functionalaties in 17k. If you watch lot of videos, movies and game a lot then this is the one for you.Only people with small hands may think about size if it matters a lot. But I will still say- size is manageable.So its good. Besides you can exchange with your old device and get even least price which was not the case with Xiaomi devices hitherto.Now that I have used for 10 days now,  I can say that it deserves 5 stars.I will still keep updating my review further if I discover anything new in it.For now,  this is really the best thing you can get in Rs.  16,999/-\n",

      "hello everyone------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------today i will share my review on this mobileif you are facing any problem regarding this or any phone or gadget you can comment below or on my youtube channel 'technical sahab'so without wasting your precious time lets get started---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Mi Max 2 designThere have been some significant design changes in the Mi Max 2 compared to the original Mi Max, despite the fact that their screens are the same size. The all-metal body of the Mi Max 2 is more appealing and now features rounded edges that make it easier to hold. The 2.5D glass across the front gives it a more premium look, although the metal back is somewhat slippery. The antenna bands are more discreet, blending in with the colour of the back.The Mi Max 2 is big for any kind of pocket, and we had some trouble carrying it around. We have used many 5.5-inch phones, and it was still hard to adjust to the Mi Max 2. During our time with this device, we found that it easily attracted people's attention just because of its sheer size. Apart from its size, weight is sometimes an issue. At 7.6mm thick, the Mi Max 2 is sleek enough and offers good grip but 211g is a lot for a phone. This is something that might (or might not) bother you.In our experience, it was uncomfortable to use this phone while walking or trying to juggle other work. We had to be extra cautious while holding it with just one hand during our review period. Typing with just one hand is a tough task, and we advise users not to try unless they are very sure of their grip.The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has backlit capacitive buttons at the front placed just below the display. There's a front-facing camera and sensors above it, accompanied by the earpiece which also doubles up as a loudspeaker. The power and volume buttons are on the right, while the hybrid dual-SIM tray is on the left. The USB Type-C port is on the bottom between two grilles, but we noticed that only one was an actual speaker while the other was just a design element.The phone has an Infrared emitter on the top panel, accompanied by the 3.5mm audio socket. We found that we could reach the fingerprint scanner on the back while holding the phone with just one hand, but we have to point out that people with smaller hands might have trouble with this.In terms of construction quality, the Mi Max 2 looks solid. Fortunately, the back panel is not a fingerprint magnet, which means you won't need to worry about wiping the phone from time to time. The Mi Max 2 has slimmer screen borders than the original Mi Max, and this means less distraction when watching videos.Xiaomi has launched the Mi Max 2 only in black, and it looks stunning, but we can expect more colour options to be released over time. Inside the retail box, you get standard set of documentats, a SIM ejector tool, a USB Type-C cable, and a charger, apart from the phone itself. Xiaomi doesn't ship earphones with any of its phones---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Xiaomi Mi Max 2 specifications and softwareThe massive 6.44-inch display has a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels, which means a density of 342ppi. It also boasts of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. Xiaomi is marketing the display as one of the best features of the Mi Max 2, but there's also a big 5300mAh battery to talk about. At the India launch event, Xiaomi even bragged that the Mi Max 2's battery can last for up to 31 days with the phone in standby, which is similar to what HMD Global has claimed for the reboot of the legendary feature phone Nokia 3310Under the hood, the Mi Max 2 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, which has been a popular SoC for phones in this price segment and it features 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage.The phone has a hybrid dual-SIM slot which might disappoint users who want to take advantage of the big screen with lots of movies and TV shows stored on a microSD card.The Mi Max 2 supports microSD cards of up to 128GB. If you create a Mi account, you'll get 5GB of cloud storage space. The phone sports a 12-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX386 sensor, f/2.2 aperture, and two-tone flash. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with an f/2.0 aperture.The Mi Max 2 runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, with Xiaomi's MIUI 8.5 skin on top.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Xiaomi Mi Max 2 performanceIt was no surprise that the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 performed just as well as the Redmi Note 4, thanks to their similar specifications.Jumping from one app to another was as smooth as it could be. 4GB of RAM is sufficient for most tasks, and we found that there was up to 1.8GB free at any given point. The phone supports 4G with VoLTE, and call quality was decent. The main problem with taking calls was the size of this phone, because it covers most of the user's face, and it becomes tedious to hold over the duration of a long call.The display is crisp and reproduces colours well. It has decent viewing angles and sunlight legibility. Images and text looked sharp despite the low pixel density. In our opinion, the Mi Max 2 has the best screen in Xiaomi's current India portfolio, considering that the Mi 5 is now over a year old. Graphics-heavy games like Asphalt 8 and Marvel: Contest of Champions ran smoothly. Despite long gaming sessions, we found that the Mi Max 2 didn't get too warm compared to the Redmi Note 4 and Moto G5 Plus.We noticed that benchmark results were slightly higher than what we have seen from other Snapdragon 625 phones. The Mi Max 2 scored 68,067 in AnTuTu; 29,555 in Quadrant; 9,211 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme; and 27fps in GFXBench. The phone handled 1080p video files as well as FLAC audio files with ease. We had a good time watching TV shows and videos on the Mi Max 2 thanks to the large 6.44-inch screen. In terms of performance, the Mi Max 2 excels compared to phones in its price segment.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Xiaomi Mi Max 2 camera performanceThe 12-megapixel rear camera uses a Sony IMX386 sensor with 1.25-micron pixels, and has an f/2.2 aperture. It does well enough in daytime but did not impress us in low light. Our sample photos showed very good colour rendition and sharpness under the right lighting conditions. Moreover, PDAF worked well in daylight too. However, in low light situations, the camera was more hit-or-miss. Autofocus was less accurate, colours seemed off, noise was quite apparent, and there was a major loss of detail. The HDR mode does well to improve dynamic range though you won't need it all the time.The Mi Max 2 can record videos at 1080p and 4K quality which is a great feature. Video quality in general was good. The phone also supports time-lapse and slow-motion video modes. The default camera app is identical to the one we saw on the Redmi Note 4, and there are modes and filters that are accessible with one tap. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera takes good selfies, but again the quality fell below average in low light.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Xiaomi Mi Max 2 battery lifeThe Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has a large, non-removable 5300mAh battery which the company claims can deliver up to two days of life. In real-world usage, the phone doesn't disappoint with its battery performance as it easily lasted up to two entire days on a single charge, even with heavy usage.We used the Mi Max 2 for roughly a week, and found that battery performance was good throughout this period. In our standard video loop test, the Mi Max 2 lasted for 23 hours and 30 minutes which is way more than what its predecessor achieved.The Mi Max 2 also supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 and parallel charging, which are both useful considering the battery size. During our review, it went from zero to 100 percent in around 100 minutes which is impressive.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VerdictWe like how Xiaomi has concentrated on things like display quality and battery life rather than other specifications with the Mi Max 2. Many would complain that Snapdragon 625 processor is now dated, but in our opinion, it's good enough for most tasks. Priced at Rs. 16,999, the Mi Max 2 offers a great package, and is targeted at users that like to watch videos, play games, and read books while on the go. The Mi Max 2 also looks better and is easier to handle than the original Mi Max. For many people, it could offer best features of a phone and a tablet in one device.The overall design is impressive while performance smooth. Battery performance left us pleasantly surprised. On the other hand, the camera could have used improvement. There haven't been many good launches in the Rs. 15,000-20,000 price band of late, so we would recommend the Mi Max 2 to anyone looking for a great display and battery performance in a smartphone in this segment, if they don't mind its size.Those looking for alternatives can go for the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus, which offers a similar screen, or the Oppo F3, which is a decent package at its price. However, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and the Moto G5 Plus are more suitable for those who want a regular-sized phone.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SCOREDesign  - 8/10Display - 8/10Software - 7/10Performence - 8/10Battery life  - 10/10Camera - 6/10Value for money- 8/10------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------so thats it for this review hope you like the reviewif you like it do not forgot to kill that helpfull buttonthanks for reading reviewtechnical sahab\n",

      "Key pointsCamera::12MP primary camera with Sony IMX386 sensor which is worth for money. f/2.2 with HDR and HD video recoding facility is present, 5MP front camera is quite good enough for video call or chat and perfect selfie in normal light condition.Verdict::Lots of people is mentioning about the camera quality, honestly its far better than Mí note4 or Mí max previous version.

No mobile camera can replace DSLR but being a photographer I can assure you that quality pic can be taken through thisPhablet Size Screen::It can be considered as advantage or disadvantage based upon the user perspective6.44-inch capacitive touchscreen with 1920 x 1080 pixels resolutions smooth touch navigation.Excellent during watching movie, live match,video clips & gaming.You can use mobile ring if you think that your palm is small to handle the phoneDual window system is available so that you can check email during watching YouTube or other stuffCorning Gorilla Glass 3 provide you a scratch resistance surface. It can prevent scratch from steel,or metalic bodyNo need to use tempered glass for unless you are rubbing the screen with sand cause sand contains quartz which makes scratches upon any  Gorilla Glass. Gorilla Glass 3 would give you thinker surface which is pretty good.You can refer YouTube video for scratch resistance test. Where screen has been tested with sharp knife,  hammer etcDesign::Design is following iPhone trend, body is sleeker than the previous version.

      "Mi Max 2 - The Beast... Go for it, without hesitation.Even though the company is Chinese, the phone is Made in India.. :PUsing it for more than a week now.Screen.The huge 6.44\" screen might make it uncomfortable to put the phone in pocket,but the pleasure it gives while watching videos, reading, playing games is unbeatable.Besides, the brightness and contrast of the screen is also good, and you can also change it manuallyto suit your needs.BatteryThe beast comes with the humongous 5300 mAh battery, which lasts almost 36 to 40 hourswith normal usage (watching videos, playing games, internet turned on).I had to charge it only 3 times during whole week.And it also charges quickly takes around 2.5 hrs to charge it completely, which is pretty fastconsidering the capacity.Body.The phone comes with fully metal uni-body, it's very sleek and smooth.And with high possibilities of sleeping out of hands. So, use it carefully.Get a cover immediately as soon as you purchase the phone.UIThe MIUI gives a nice experience, comes in with many inbuilt tools, like cleaner, battery optimizer,TV Remote ,app lock, Dual apps( you can use two different accounts of Facebook, whatsap etc.)It also gives you the privilege to select which app should auto-start and which shouldn't(on other devices,you need root permission for this.)The notification panel is also impressive, you can sort the shortcuts as per your need.It also has the setting to select whether or not to show the notification symbol in status bar or not. It also comes with the Read-mode, so you don't need to have any third party white light filter app.CameraCamera is a bit disappointment. Mi says it uses Sony sensors, but the picture quality isn't up to the mark.Especially, for low light pictures.The stock camera app gives you less quality pictures. But if you use anythird party apps, you can get nice pics.CPU, RAM and GPUThe processor and the RAM performs to the satisfaction. I'm playing Asphalt 8, Gods of Rome, Real racing 3and not facing any lagging issues or graphics problems. Works smoothly.At any given moment, you get at least 2 GB RAM free, which is quite sufficient.SensorsThe fingerprint sensors is pretty much faster than some of the other devices I've used.You can use your finger print to as a screen lock, as well as the app lock.(The app lock feature also comes in MIUI)StorageComes with the 64 GB internal storage, out of which 53 GB is available to user. It is very sufficient.You don't need the memory card.The phone has hybrid sim slot, which means you can use either two sims, or one sim+ memory card.But considering the internal storage you get, you probably don't need to have additional memory card.Calling quality is good and crispy. It does support the VoLTE, so you can use your Jio card in it. ;)The phone does show two speaker slots at the bottom, and Xiaomi also says the phone has dual speaker,but actually, speaker is only on the left side of the phone, and on the right side it has mic.But while watching videos, the earpiece works as the speaker(not very loud though), and you get a stereo effect.It's slightly heavy(211 g, as said in specs) so your hands may get stressed if you keep it holding for too long.So, considering the features, and the price, the phone is worth buying, if you're looking for abig screen and bigger battery.Just go for it.Great reading and viewing experience\n",

      "Great phone with excellent battery,  didn't discover anything more. What I didn't like is the size. You can't really operate with one hand.. While Travelling,  working etc,  it becomes a burden to carry this phone. If you are are only home to office user,  watch movies or play games only.. Them I think u can opt this.. Else dont ever think to buy..\n",

      "Its been a while since I have been completely smitten by a phone, but Im completely in love with the Mi Max 2 and it feels like a complete phone in every way. I have always used bigger phones over the last 5 years, the Nokia 1520, Huawei Mate, One Plus One, Gionee M5 Plus and the original Mi Max. I recently drooped my Mi Max and broke it into pieces, so the Mix Max 2 was the logical choice.The phone by itself is big, make no mistake about it. But its not as much a beast as it seems at first sight. Most people simply look in shock at how big it feels in my pocket and ask for it, but the moment take it from me out of curiosity, the general consensus is that it feels great in the hands. But if you have small hands and have never used more than a 5 inch phone in your life, stay away from this one. If 5.5 inch phones feel great to you, then you should upgrade to a 6.4\" Mi Max 2.Having used the original Mi Max, this one feels like a sweet upgrade, nothing important got changed and everything else is better. I do not want to waste time on the obvious specs, but the processor hits the perfect sweet spot of power vs battery, there is absolutely no heat in the phone even after extended browsing sessions, the camera is simply amazing and top notch (in daylight) and most importantly, the curved glass in black looks and feels just perfect. Im unable to find a single negative with the phone except for low light camera shots which seem to be grainy.The battery on the phone is keeping me amazed for the past week. I have used and used and used the phone for hours, mind you no games, just browsing, checking emails and social media and youtube. And the battery never falls to less than 60% in the night. Im routinely using it for two full days and and the second night, I charge when it gets to around 20% charge left. If I was not pushing the phone so much and when the honeymoon ends, I have a gut feel it will last me 3 days easily. And plugging in the included fast charger for half hour gives enough charge to the phone to last a day.The speed and feel of the touch screen is similarly awesome. The signal strength is perfect and the Wifi picks weak signals that my old phones could not even see. The finger print is crazy fast too, rejecting the bad and picking the correct finger press in a instant.All in all, a perfect phone in every way. This is gonna be with me for a while. If big phones are your need, dont overlook this one.\n",

It also boasts of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. Xiaomi even bragged that the Mi Max 2's battery can last for up to 31 days with the phone in standby, which is similar to what HMD Global has claimed for the reboot of the legendary feature phone Nokia 3310.Under the hood, the Mi Max 2 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, which has been a popular SoC for phones in this price segment. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 , Moto G5 Plus, and Lenovo P2 are some of the models that are powered by the same SoC. Unlike most Redmi smartphones, only one variant of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has been launched, and it features 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage.The phone sports a 12-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX386 sensor, f/2.2 aperture, and two-tone flash. There's also a 5-megapixel front camera with an f/2.0 aperture.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________SOFTWARE----The Mi Max 2 is Xiaomi’s first device to be powered by Android Nougat out of the box. It runs the company’s proprietary UI layer, MIUI 8.5, based on Android 7.1.1.Despite running the latest Android version, Mi Max 2 doesn’t offer split-screen functionality which is really a missed opportunity on a device with large display. However, Xiaomi has announced that the feature will roll out with an update soon, and is already available in beta.The Mi Max 2 is a unique device that sits right on the intersection of a large smart phone and a portable tablet. While a lot of people shrug their shoulders looking at the device, there is a definite market for it, as was evident by the success of Mi Max.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________DESIGN----There have been some significant design changes in the Mi Max 2 compared to the original Mi Max despite the fact that their screens are the same size. The all-metal body of the Mi Max 2 is more appealing and now features rounded edges that make it easier to hold. The 2.5D glass across the front gives it a more premium look, although the metal back is somewhat slippery. The antenna bands are more discreet, blending in with the colour of the back.I have used many 5.5-inch phones, and it was still hard to adjust to the Mi Max 2. Apart from its size, weight is sometimes an issue. At 7.6mm thick, the Mi Max 2 is sleek enough and offers good grip but 211g is a lot for a phone. This is something that might (or might not) bother you.It is uncomfortable to use this phone while walking or trying to juggle other work. Typing with just one hand is a tough task, and I advise users not to try unless they are very sure of their grip.The phone has an Infrared (IR) blaster on the top panel, accompanied by the 3.5mm audio socket (THAAANK GOD). I was able reach the fingerprint scanner on the back while holding the phone with just one hand, but think that people with smaller hands might have trouble with this.In terms of construction quality, the Mi Max 2 looks solid. Fortunately, the back panel is not a fingerprint magnet, which means you won't need to worry about wiping the phone from time to time. The Mi Max 2 has slimmer screen borders than the original Mi Max, and this means less distraction when watching videos.Xiaomi has launched the Mi Max 2 only in black, and it looks stunning. Inside the retail box, you get standard set of documents, a SIM ejector tool, a USB Type-C cable, and a charger, apart from the phone itself.  Xiaomi doesn't ship earphones with any of its phones.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________HARDWARE----The Mi Max 2 sports a hybrid SIM slot, so you can either use two SIMs or one SIM and one micro SD card. A lot of multimedia hoarders who use two SIMs don’t usually like this arrangement – more so in a device targeted towards that group – but there’s a generous 64 GB internal storage and many people will be content with that.Thankfully, the smart phone boasts stereo speakers, which offer quite a loud sound. While one of the speakers is at the bottom, the other one is next to the earpiece. This arrangement is slightly awkward for directional stereo sounds, but not many people will notice it.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________DISPLAY----The Mi Max 2 features a Full HD 6.44-inch display which gives it a pixel density 342ppi. A higher resolution on a phone of this size and price would’ve been nice, but that would’ve also required a more powerful processor which I think should’ve been there.The display offers a decent level of color reproduction, and the contrast is good and it looks vibrant. The brightness levels are just about okay and phone also offers good daylight visibility, but auto-brightness doesn’t always work well and I had to resort to manual calibration sometimes.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________CAMERA & VIDEO----The camera on the Mi Max 2 is just about okay. The 12-megapixel rear camera uses a Sony IMX386 sensor with 1.25-micron pixels, and has an f/2.2 aperture. It has a good color reproduction and contrast in daylight, but the lack of detail is very apparent. The phase detection autofocus mechanism facilitates faster focusing and works quite well in daylight.In low light though, the camera is a hit-and-miss, and captures average photos. Most photos are noisy, and the lack of sharpness hurts the overall image quality. There’s dual LED flash, but it ends up washing out the subject and I didn’t really like using it. The 5-megapixel front camera takes good enough selfies in daylight but not so pretty ones in low light. There is no selfie flash which is a bit letdown for selfie lovers.*** No dual cameras on this phoneThe Mi Max 2 can record videos at 1080p and 4K quality which is a great feature. The video quality is also pretty good and in well-lit conditions, it is remarkable.  The phone also supports time-lapse and slow-motion video modes. The default camera app is identical to the one on the Redmi Note 4, and there are modes and filters that are accessible with one tap. However, since there’s no optical image stabilization, most videos tend to be quite shaky, especially since it’s hard to hold a large phone with a steady hand.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________PERFORMANCE----It was no surprise that the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 performed just as well as the Redmi Note 4, thanks to their similar specifications. Jumping from one app to another was as smooth as it could be. 4GB of RAM is sufficient for most tasks, and we found that there was up to 1.8GB free at any given point. The phone supports 4G with VoLTE, and call quality was decent. The main problem with taking calls was the size of this phone, because it covers most of the user's face, and it becomes tedious to hold over the duration of a long call.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________BATTERY----The Mi Max 2 packs in a large non-removable 5,300 mAh battery which easily gives two days of battery life on a single charge, even if you’re a heavy user like me. Xiaomi claims 11 hours of non-stop game play, and the claim isn’t misplaced. I streamed HD movies from Amazon Prime Video continuously for over 12 hours starting at full charge, and still had some juice left when I was done. (Nice Harry Potter marathon, by the way!)The Mi Max 2 also supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 and parallel charging, which is very important for smart phones with this big a battery else it takes annoyingly long to charge fully. Mi Max 2 takes 100 minutes to go from zero to 100 percent charge, which is impressive._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________COMPARISON WITH LENOVO PHAB 2 PLUS—a) The Phab 2 Plus comes with dual rear cameras unlike Xiaomi mi max 2 which has only a single rear camera. The Lenovo camera is better than the Xiaomi one.b) The Phab 2 Plus comes sports a 8 megapixel front camera unlike the Xiaomi mi max 2 which has only a 5 megapixel front camera. The Lenovo beats the Xiaomi here too.c) The design of Lenovo Phab 2 Plus also beats the Xiaomi mi max 2.d) The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus feature Dolby Atmos technology which delivers a cinematic audio performance unlike the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 which feature only dual speakers.e) The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 boasts a massive 5,300 mAh battery while the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus has only a 4,050 mAh battery which is quite small for a multimedia-orientated smartphone.f) The Mi Max 2 comes with 64 GB of storage while the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus comes with only 32 GB storage which is quite less for a multimedia orientated smart phone.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ VERDICT----I liked how Xiaomi has concentrated on things like display quality and battery life rather than other specifications with the Mi Max 2. Many would complain that Snapdragon 625 processor is now outdated, but in my opinion, it's good enough for most tasks although the company could have used a more powerful processor from the Qualcomm SnapDragon 600 series.  Priced at Rs. 16,999, the Mi Max 2 offers a great package, and is targeted at users that like to watch videos, play games, and read books while on the go. The Mi Max 2 also looks better and is easier to handle than the original Mi Max. For many people, it could offer best features of a phone and a tablet in one device.The overall design is impressive while performance smooth. Battery performance left me pleasantly surprised. On the other hand, the camera could have used improvement. There haven't been many good launches in the Rs. 15,000-20,000 price band of late, so we would recommend the Mi Max 2 to anyone looking for a great display and battery performance in a smart phone in this segment, if they don't mind its size.Those looking for alternatives can go for the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus which is a decent package at its price. However, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and the Moto G5 Plus are more suitable for those who want a regular-sized phone.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________************************************************************************************************************************************************************************THANKS\n",

      "============== INTRODUCTION==============The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 fails to improve on existing weaknesses from the Mi Max, and is not an upgrade. That said, it is a good buy for those who do not already have a Mi Max.The Mi Max 2 is a unique device that sits on the intersection of a large smartphone and a portable tablet, and excels at that offering an incredible battery life.The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is the right budget phablet for those who don't have the Mi Max already. Premium buyers can get a far better phone with the Galaxy C9 Pro.=============== SPECIFICATIONS===============• Display: 6.44 inch FHD• RAM: 4GB• ROM: 128GB• Rear Camera: 12MP• Front Camera: 5MP• Chipset: Snapdragon 625• Battery: 5300 mAh======== PROS :-)======== Premium looks and solid build quality Battery life is impressive Overall performance is decent Quick charging support======== CONS :-(======== Too bulky for any pocket Hybrid dual-SIM slot Camera could have been better=============== BOX CONTENTS===============• Xiaomi Mi Max 2• Adapter• USB Cable• User Manual================================================ DISPLAY : SAME WEAKNESS, BUT SLIGHTLY IMPROVED...================================================The Mi Max 2 is meant for media consumption and you don’t expect the user to hold such a huge phone in his/her hand through a whole movie.To be clear, you don’t see the colour shift all the time, but it’ll be an issue if two or three people are trying to watch a video on it. I propped the phone up next to me, while I sat right beside it. My head was about two feet above the display, looking directly at it, and I could see the colour shift from certain positions. This is an issue in the long run, since one almost never watches a full movie without changing positions in between. On this large a screen, the smallest anomaly seems pronounced, and that’s why I can’t get over the viewing angles’ misstep.I watched the first episode of Game of Thrones’ new season on this phone, and the scenes set in the night were often difficult to watch. That’s also thanks to a dim-ish display, which can be an issue when watching stuff outdoors. Xiaomi’s auto-brightness algorithms aren’t the greatest and I’d suggest depending on manual calibration for this one.On the flipside, the Mi Max 2 sports better contrast than its predecessor. So, things look more vibrant when looking straight at the display. The reds are redder and the difference in black and white is enhanced. Reading on Pocket’s dark mode is pleasant and high quality content, as on Amazon Prime Video or Netflix, looks good. A year apart from its predecessor, the Mi Max 2 is still a good phone for video consumption.With the dimensions, resolution and pixel density remaining the same, the Mi Max 2’s display looks better than its predecessor at first. But it’s not much of an improvement, thanks to sub-par viewing angles.========================= BATTERY : CLASS LEADING...=========================The only real claim Xiaomi is making with the Mi Max 2 is extended battery life. The company likened the device to the Nokia 3310 at launch. But while that’s a tad far fetched, the Mi Max 2 is one of the few smartphones that can hold a candle against the 3310. Keeping the comparisons aside for now, the Mi Max 2 is a battery monster.PC Mark’s Work 2.0 battery test takes nearly 18-odd hours to churn battery power down from 80% to 20%. Xiaomi claims 11 hours of non-stop gameplay, which is quite believable. I streamed 10 hours of non-stop HD video without a break, on 80% battery. When I was done, the Mi Max 2 still had 19% battery left.Xiaomi has made a point of touting battery sizes on its new smartphones, and this is the biggest change in this year’s device. While the Mi Max wasn’t bad to start with, the Mi Max 2’s battery life is enhanced and surpasses the Lenovo P2’s standards. Of course, the power efficient Snapdragon 625 chipset plays a big role here.========================================== PERFORMANCE : WORKS ,BUT NOT PERFORMS...==========================================The Snapdragon 625 is a proven chipset, powering the lion’s share of sub-20k smartphones today. Qualcomm’s efforts with this one have been to strike a balance between power consumption and speed, and in that endeavour, the 625 succeeds once again on the Mi Max 2. That said, there’s a striking compromise in speed here, which only Mi Max users will notice.The Snapdragon 625 supports up to 1080p display, and at this size, this is the most power hungry 1080p display one can think of. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 650 supports QHD panels, so a 6.44 inch 1080p display was easier for it to handle. As a result, there’s a sense of sloth about the Mi Max 2 that I can’t quite appreciate, having been a Mi Max user. The zippiness is missing from MiUI, which is what attracted me to the Mi Max in the first place. A big screen phone that’s fast and smooth is a treat to use. A big screen phone that is even slightly slow can be frustrating for nitpickers like me.I’m not saying that the Mi Max 2 is a slow phone, but that it ‘feels’ slower than the Mi Max. On its own, the Mi Max 2 is an able performer, but not an outrightly fast smartphone.Battery life will assist you in long gaming sessions and frame rates will drop very rarely and only over extended gaming sessions, as long as you’re indoors in air conditioned rooms. That too is true for the most intensive games only, while most others can run at playable frame rates of 30fps and above.Performance on the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is reasonable, which I suspect is what Xiaomi was going for in the first place. This product I suspect is created to target a still niche market, which cares about the phone’s display size over anything else.================================================== CAMERA : LESSER PIXELS, BUT BETTER IMAGE QUALITY...==================================================The Mi Max 2 is a poster boy for the megapixels debate in smartphone cameras. It has a 12MP Sony IMX386 sensor and f/2.2 aperture. Neither of those specs stand out, except the fact that its predecessor had a 16MP sensor and f/2.0 aperture. You need to get past the specs here, because the Mi Max 2 indeed clicks better photos than the Mi Max.Xiaomi has been able to enhance contrast levels and colour reproduction, but details are still lacking on this camera. In essence, the Mi Max 2’s camera is better than its predecessors, but far behind competing smartphones. You will get shareable photos when shooting in daylight, but low light photos are consistently average. It doesn’t take a pixel peeper to notice the undersaturated colours and lack of details in photos.=========================================== BUILD & DESIGN : BIG DONE IN THE WRONG WAY...===========================================The Mi Max 2 has almost exactly the same dimensions as its predecessor, but it feels more unwieldy. This is probably the only form factor where the rounded Apple/Oppo-like form factor doesn’t work. You can’t really get a good grip on the phone, and its rounded sides make it nearly impossible to prop it up against something on a table or bed. The phone is not meant to be ergonomic to start with, but this is one of the chief reasons why I think rehashing the same design again and again doesn’t work.What Xiaomi has done here is it has taken the trending design this year, and put it on the Mi Max, forgetting that it really doesn’t work in this form factor. You have it all with this device, including the antenna line running along the top. I would certainly agree that the Mi Max 2 is a prettier phone than its predecessor, and the metal on it feels more premium, but the design is yet another reason why the Mi Max 2 isn’t an upgrade.You will find the usual capacitive buttons on the front, while the camera sensor sits flush on the top left of the back. There’s a fingerprint near the center of the rear panel, but it’s a clean design otherwise, attractive but not ergonomic.=================== HOW IT COMPARES ?===================The Mi Max 2 is still the best budget phablet option for prospective buyers. Its competitors include the Lenovo Phab 2 and Phab 2 Plus, neither of which can outperform this phone in any way.I would recommend Samsung’s C series phones to you, but they’re far too expensive for someone buying a sub-20k smartphone. Despite its weaknesses, the pricing of the Mi Max 2 makes it the best in its genre of smartphones, although premium phone buyers can get better with the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro.It goes without saying that a person eyeing the Moto G5S Plus isn’t likely to be interested in the Mi Max. However, for those who want to put the two phones in the same segment, the Moto G5S Plus is faster, has a better camera and competitive battery life. It, and its competitors, including the Honor 6X , are better performing (in the overall sense) and more value for money smartphones than the Xiaomi Mi Max 2.============== FINAL VERDICT==============As mentioned above, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is the budget phablet to buy, but it’s not an upgrade from the Mi Max. In fact, I would still recommend that device, if you can get your hands on it. The Mi Max 2 is for those who want a good looking budget phablet, and do not have the Mi Max already. It gets extra marks for more storage and a better camera, but it could have been much better had Xiaomi improved on existing weaknesses.So that's it guys if you like my review Kindly mark the \" Helpful\" option below so this may be useful to others too....&.You owe me a Smile :-)\n",
